Global File
-----------

New parallel file format
------------------------
- data from all processors gets written to single file
- in processors/ directory, e.g.:
    processors/0.1/p
- it is still decomposed data!
- all processor bits are appended into single file
- master writes the file, all the slaves send to master
- selectable through 'fileHandler':
    - uncollated (default): all processors write their own data
    - masterUncollated    : same as uncollated but only master reads/writes
                            (slaves can run without NFS access their processor directory)
    - collated            : all slaves send to master; master writes collated file
                            (with optional threading)


fileHandler
-----------
- all (parallel) IO should go through fileHandler()
- which is a single instance of one of the methods above
- is used automatically for all regIOobjects using streaming
  (almost all containers)
- but all other calls (e.g. OFstream, exists) should be rewritten to
  use the file handler, e.g. for OFstream, exists:

        autoPtr<Ostream> osPtr(fileHandler().NewOFstream("myFile");
        Ostream& os = osPtr();

    respectively

        bool haveFile = fileHandler().exists("myFile");
- fileHandlers are used for
    - OSspecific functionality (e.g. exists)
    - regIOobject reading, writing
    - file-change monitoring
- default is the 'uncollated' version. A different one can be selected
  using (in increasing order of priority)
    - environment variable FOAM_FILEHANDLER
    - 'fileHander' entry in etc/controlDict
    - command line option -fileHandler XXX
    - 'fileHander' entry in system/controlDict
- parallel communication is done using non-blocking communication by
  default. This means that the total buffer size needed is the overall
  length of a file on all processors. In etc/controlDict there is a
  parameter:

    // In master-only reading/writing: when to switch from non-blocking
    // to scheduled. This is the overall file size
    maxBufferSize    1000000000


collated fileHandler
--------------------
- uses the collated file format ('decomposedBlockData', always written
in binary)
- optionally uses threading. This is controlled through the etc/controlDict:

    // Thread buff size (sum of all waiting writes). Set to 0 do disable
    // threading.
    maxThreadBufferSize 3000000000;


Backwards compatibility
-----------------------
- uncollated mode should behave exactly as before
- foamFormatConvert can be used to change the format
- decomposePar, reconstructPar


Implementation
--------------
- the case name still contains the processorDDD directory, e.g.
processorDDD/cavity
- it is only scanning/reading/writing that gets intercepted.


Writing:
- regIOobject::writeObject is the main writing routine. It normally opens
a file stream (OFstream) and uses the writeData routine to stream
the data into the file.
- there are two changes to this process:
    - the fileName used for writing is now obtained from the fileHandler.
    The uncollated fileHandler returns the objectPath() as before, the
    collating one returns the equivalent path in the processors/ directory.
    - instead of an OFstream a masterCollatingOFstream is opened and returned.
    This is an OStringStream and in its destruction will collect all the
    processor contributions on the master and write the file.
- special handling is for the lagrangian data which only gets read/written
  if there are particles. Since we still need to have a call to the writing
  on all processors a flag gets passed which tells the fileHandler whether
  to actually write the file. In the collocated writer this writes a dummy
  entry.
- non-parallel running (e.g. decomposePar): the collating writer assumes
the processors are handled in order and adds the section for the current
processor to the collated file.


Reading:
- reading is done through regIOobject::readStream() which opens a file
and returns a stream
- reading is done in two steps:
    - find the file ('filePath()'). This searching is done inside the
    fileHandler so can be overridden when necessary.
    - open and return a stream to the file. In case of the uncollated
    fileHandler this uses IFstream, in case of the masterUncollated/collated
    fileHandlers this:
        - sends all the filenames to the master
        - detects if it is a single (collated) file in the processors/
        directory
        - and opens the file(s) and sends the contents back to the slaves.
        These then return the contents to the caller as an IStringStream.
- non-parallel running (e.g. reconstructPar): reading collated files determines
the processor number from the casename and uses this to index the collated
file so e.g. 'paraFoam -case processor0' still works.


Other:
- special handling to get the number of processor directories.
- special handling to set the time and get the time directories.
- special handling to get the IOobjects for a time.


Debugging
---------
- set the debug variables for the fileOperation types:
    DebugSwitches
    {
        uncollated          1;
        masterUncollated    1;
        collated            1;
    }
- if a parallel run is hanging connect with e.g. gdb and see where it
  is hanging. The fileHandler calls should always be made on all processors
  at the same time (i.e. synchronous); if this is not possible the fileHandler
  mechanism should not be used.

- with collated: errors of the form:
        unexpected class name IOobject expected faceSet
  Try and disable threading (set maxThreadBufferSize 0) or use a different
  writer. Especially topoSet does writing and reading of the same file
  and with threading this might conflict.
  Maybe run topoSet with a different fileHandler?


Benchmarking
------------
- applications/test/CompactIOList
- write binary faceCompactIOList, 10000000 quads (= 200Mbytes binary data)
- 8 processors so in total 1.6Gb data to write
- all slaves wait for master (scatter of os.good()) so are as slow
  as the master.

Todo:
- rewrite all OSspecific calls (that are parallel aware) to use the
  fileHandler()
- FIXED. do the remaining lagrangian.
- mdFoam/nanoNozzle: mdFoam: pairPotentialList.C
- FIXED. determine priority of -envvar, -argList, -system/controlDict
- globalCellModeller, debugSwitches cannot use fileHandler
- redistributePar
- master*OFstream with uniform file
- Lagrangian IOField reading:
    - if both processors and processorDDD then
      the processors without IOField will search for
        processors/<field>
      instead of processorDDD/<field>
  Small problem since generally not running with both.
- have syncPar flag on all low-level routines
- indexing for single processor reading in decomposedBlockData::readBlock
- FIXED.paraFoam exits with double free or corruption in _ZN4Foam9freeMutexEi+0x29
- FIXED. better error message if dictionary or field not found.
- FIXED. decomposePar -allRegions. uncollated/collated are fine with
  processor0/0/bottomAir/p but not processors/0/bottomAir/p
- FIXED. rename fileOperation::fileHandlerType to fileOperation::defaultFileHandler
- FIXED. cache Times (done in masterUncollated, collated)
- FIXED. fix static destruction error in readers loaded through libs().
- avoid copying data in decomposedBlockData, OFstreamWriter
- FIXED. foamFormatConvert do lagrangian
    - collated -> uncollated ok
    - uncollated -> collated : only if master proc has cloud
- test app: applications/test/decomposedBlockData can extract the data
  from collated files.
