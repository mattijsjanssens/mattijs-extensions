A) Keeping CHT framework
------------------------

Implicit coupling
-----------------
- assemble matrix, make inter-region patches coupled.
- needs overall field since
  fvMatrix::solve uses boundary contributions and
  does correctBoundaryConditions
- overall field now also needs the overall mesh
- maybe avoid overall mesh by having
  fvMatrix::solve with multiple supplied meshes, fields:
    static fvMatrix::solveSegregated
    (
        const UPtrList<fvMatrix>& eqns,
        const lduMatrix& allMatrix,
        const PtrList<labelList>& faceMaps, // how to collect/flip faces
        const PtrList<cellList>& cellMaps,  // how to collect cells
        const dictionary&
    );

Merging
-------
- assemble matrix, make inter-region patches internal
faces. See overset on how to add internal faces and
manipulate matrix accordingly.
- solving same as above


B) Single mesh
--------------

Masking
-------
- solve all equations everywhere. Use masking to suppress
momentum eqn etc. in solids. Or is p-U coupling valid in solids?
- usually not big overhead since fluid >> solid

splitMeshRegions
----------------
- Generate subMeshes, subFields on the fly
