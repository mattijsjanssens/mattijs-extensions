ddtCorr(U, phi)

= 1: phi-p coupling
= 0: p-U coupling (supports p waves)

Ideally we want phi-p coupling but then the U might
just drift away from the flux. Either
- (add a bit of) reconstruct U from phi (Hilary has done this)
- or have the minimum amount of ddtCorr.

Problem: we're deciding something based on (predicted) U
and phi and for very small time steps these are apples and
pears. So either
- use velocity transported-to-face (so Co=0.5) to compare
- or scale ddtCorr with time step


2) pitzDaily with high-aspect-ratio cells.
If mitre around corner:
- pressure between cells around corner is related
- but velocity is not!
so how do you choose discretisation? Better
is not to mitre but have a corner cell?
