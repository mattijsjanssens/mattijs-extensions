1D motion:
- this is only applicable for if the boundary conditions are 1D
- if they are not, i.e. do not span the whole domain
- then the problem is actually 2D/3D
- and an 3D elliptic solver (displacementComponentLaplacian!)
  will still produce a 2D/3D solution.
- no amount of patchType override, pointLocation bcs will fix this.
- only if you choose a 1D interpolation solver (displacementInterpolation)
  will it work.
- and this means that you have to 'extend' the specification of the
  partial boundaries to be fully 1D.
