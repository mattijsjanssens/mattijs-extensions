- two neighbouring cells
- iso surface has small polyp sticking into cells above
- (but only using pyramid edges)
- now when filtering all but real edges it will squeeze out the
neck of the polyp and cause non-manifold edges.

- the basic reason is that we're creating new edges and if
'the other side' does the same it pinches off.

prevention:
- collect new face
- check that all points are not co-planar? Can happen easily
- check that uses at least three faces?
