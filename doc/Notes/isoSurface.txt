- points originate from
    - face edges
    - face-diagonal edges
    - pyramid edges
- problem is the diagonal removal
- since this creates a surface 'edge' between two face edges
- usually this is no problem since these vertices are
  on a single face (inbetween two cells)
- but for some refinement patterns there might be another
  face creating the same surface 'edge'
- so:
    - store the point-pair together with the face
    - do not allow the same collapse on any other face.



#- two neighbouring cells
#- iso surface has small polyp sticking into cells above
#- (but only using pyramid edges)
#- now when filtering all but real edges it will squeeze out the
#neck of the polyp and cause non-manifold edges.
#
#- the basic reason is that we're creating new edges and if
#'the other side' does the same it pinches off.
#
#prevention:
#- collect new face
#- check that all points are not co-planar? Can happen easily
#- check that uses at least three faces?
