User wants application with e.g. hacked snappyHexMesh functionality.
Say triSurfaceTools.C

- user provides application-to-patch and absolute filename (.H or .C):
src/meshTools/triSurface/triSurfaceTools/triSurfaceTools.C

- wmakeLocal
- user provides filename
- scripts finds original source and from it:
    - wrmdep -> files including it
    - library
    - wlib -> libraries including library
    -
    -> $objectsDir
    -> 


=> from library meshTools
=> used by any meshTools files?


- script detects
    - compilation dependencies
    - direct uses: includes (scan .dep) & compilation dependencies
    - link uses: includes library & compilation dependencies
- script copies:
    - all files
    - adds to
        Make/files
        Make/options
