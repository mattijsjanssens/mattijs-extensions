20181116: Henry had problem with
- createBaffles
- mergeOrSplitBaffles -split
- moveMesh
since it was moving the incorrect points. Problem is already in the
createBaffles where it was creating the AMI out of randomly oriented
faceZone (used 'setToFaceZone' instead of 'setsToFaceZone')

checkMesh will report:
incorrect face normal when matching face XXX to YYY. This is logical
since AMI is split into two halves - it cannot be expected to decide
for itself which one to match to which one.
